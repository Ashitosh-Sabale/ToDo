📝 To-Do List App
This is a simple To-Do List App where users can add tasks, delete tasks, and keep track of their daily to-do items. Although the app currently has basic functionality, I plan to add more features once my college exams are over!

🚀 Features (Current Version)
✅ Add a new task
✅ Delete a task
✅ Mark a task as complete (Optional)
✅ Basic UI for better user experience

🗒️ To-Do (Upcoming Features)
I plan to add these features after my exams:📌 Edit tasks functionalityaq
📌 Task categories (e.g., Work, Personal, Study)
📌 Save tasks in LocalStorage or database
📌 Responsive design for mobile devices
📌 User authentication (optional)

🎯 Goals
This project is part of my learning process, and I will enhance it after my college exams. For now, it’s a simple app built with the limited time I have.
